# Raspberry Pi time_cam

A quick python script for use with the Raspberry Pi's camera module. The purpose of this script is focused around providing a timestamp overlay for recordings or video streams, a functionality not found in raspivid (the default utility). This script is designed to work out of the box for any fresh install of Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi (and will would on any other Raspberry PI running Linux with Python 3 install - so basically all of them). 

This script is designed to be as simple as possible, for more options simply download it and run with with either `--help` or `-h`
